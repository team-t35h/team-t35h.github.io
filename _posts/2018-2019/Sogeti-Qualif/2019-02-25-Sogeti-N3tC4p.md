# [](#network) N3tC4p [ 479 points ] (Author: Syngard)

## [](#presentation)Presentation

We are given a file named `USB.iso`, which appears to be a disk image.
```
$ file USB.iso 
USB.iso: ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'CDROM'
```

## [](#step1)Step 1: Extrating the files

The first thing we have to do is to extract whatever file is in the image.
There are [several ways to do so via the command line](https://www.tecmint.com/extract-files-from-iso-files-linux/) and I chose to use 7zip as it's pretty straightforward.

```
$ 7z x USB.iso     

7-Zip [64] 16.02 : Copyright (c) 1999-2016 Igor Pavlov : 2016-05-21

$ ls
DOCUMENT  LINKS  PICTURE  USB.iso
```

We then find a zip archive in the `DOCUMENT` folder. Inside are two files: `challenge_network.keys` and `challenge_network.pcapng`

## [](#step2)Step 2: Exploiting the network capture

Let's open the `pcap` file in WireShark. We can see that there are some `TLS 1.2` packets, which means that the part of the traffic is encrypted. But we also found a `.keys` file, so that may be useful. 

```
$ cat challenge_network.keys 
CLIENT_RANDOM 5c44694d7d7869bfe4b0717a11393859b46494580e7ca4326e3d2d80aadd158a 14e4

db3c9e84d
```

What kind of file is that ? A quick google search gives us [all the answers we need](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format). So now we now where to plug the key in WireShark and hopefully that will decrypt the network traffic.

Once we tell WireShark to use the key file, we can see the network traffic in clear.

The most apparent thing is the `HTTP` request/response that is now appearing. It seems like it was a request to download a file named `secret.zip`. To retrieve it, we ccan use File -> Export Object -> HTTP and save the only file detected. 

Before moving on with the zip file, I'd like to mention that there is another interesting element in the `.pcap` file: some IRC packets excange. Choosing Follow -> TCP Stream on one of them gives us the following conversation :

```
NICK /SERVER
USER pixis kali 192.168.56.1 :*Unknown*
:work 432 * /SERVER :Erroneous nickname

QUIT :Leaving
```

The interesting thing here is that they indicate that the zip file is password-protected but that the password is easy to guess.

## [](#step3)Step 3: Cracking the zip file

Since the password is supposedly easy to guess, it's pretty likely that it is in a classic password dictionnary. Obviously we won't try to guess it by hand but there is a plethora of tools to do this kind of work. As for me, I tend to use [this one](https://passwordrecovery.io/zip-file-password-removal/). We upload the zip file and are almost immediately rewarded with: `Success!! The password for secret.zip was found: thuglife`

We then juste have to open the archive with this password.

```
$ unzip secret.zip  
Archive:  secret.zip
[secret.zip] newpassword.txt password: 
 extracting: newpassword.txt         
$ cat newpassword.txt 
SCE{Th1s_1s_our_n3w_k3y-w0rd}
```
